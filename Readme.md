### Setup

### Dimensions of the Machinist
#### What is the _actual_ largest cut I can make?

#### Tramming
- What is tramming?
 - When your router is not set up perpendicular to the work surface (tilted).

 - Fill this in 

#### Will the `Superdooper router by xyz corp work?` 
- As of this writing, if it is 65mm diameter, it _should_.
- Why the Makita on not the DeWalt?
 - Onefinity reps have told me that the brushes live longer in the Makita, over long run times, than those in the DeWalt.
#### Can I use an 80mm Spindle?
- As of this writing, Onefinity does not have the 80mm mount ready for use yet.
- <User> _has_ created a 3d model and 3d printed an 80mm mount, but it is still in testing.

### Bits
#### What bits do I _need_?
#### Where can I buy _QUALITY_ bits? (also, does quality matter?)
#### What is upcut/downcut?
#### What is a 'compression' bit?
#### Does a higher cost really indicate a better product? (million dollar question)

### To wasteboard or not to wasteboard
#### What material should I use?
#### Is there a 'file' for surfacing?
#### Do I need grids / inserts / dovetail / T-tracks / Vacuum table?
#### Surfacing -- or -- Let's get that thing as flat as Kansas
#### Methods of securing
- T-track
- T-nuts
- Blue Painters tape and Cyanoacrilate
- Cam clamps
- Using your fingers to hold down really small pieces.
