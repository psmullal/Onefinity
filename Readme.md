### Setup
#### Dimensions of the Woodworker
##### What is the _actual_ largest cut I can make?
#### Dimensions of the Machinist
##### What is the _actual_ largest cut I can make?
#### Assembly
#### Table or Enclosure?
#### Verical or Horizontal (or any angle in between)?

### Dust Collection
### How loud is this thing really?
### Router or Spindle?
#### Tramming
- What is tramming?
  - When your router is not set up perpendicular to the work surface (tilted).
- How do I 'tram'?

#### Will the `Superdooper router by xyz corp work?` 
- As of this writing, if it is 65mm diameter, it _should_.
- Why the Makita on not the DeWalt?
 - Onefinity reps have told me that the brushes live longer in the Makita, over long run times, than those in the DeWalt.
#### Can I use an 80mm Spindle?
- As of this writing, Onefinity does not have the 80mm mount ready for use yet.
- [Hrubesky](https://forum.onefinitycnc.com/t/80mm-spindle-mount/3459) _has_ created a 3d model and 3d printed an 80mm mount, but it is still in testing.
- [Onefinity's Official Thread](https://forum.onefinitycnc.com/t/all-your-80mm-spindle-questions-in-this-thread/2590)

### Bits
#### What bits do I _need_?
#### Where can I buy _QUALITY_ bits? (also, does quality matter?)
#### What is upcut/downcut?
#### What is a 'compression' bit?
#### Does a higher cost really indicate a better product? (million dollar question)

### To wasteboard or not to wasteboard
#### What material should I use for my wasteboard?
#### OH NO! I cut into my wasteboard! Now what?!
- Guess what? That is what it is for. Depending on the type, depth, and location of the cut, it may not be a bit deal. If it is shallow enough, and you have the clearance, you can always resurface and be crisp and clean all over again. Just make sure you re-home!
#### Is there a 'file' for surfacing?
#### Do I need grids / inserts / dovetail / T-tracks / Vacuum table?
#### Surfacing -- or -- Let's get that thing as flat as Kansas
#### Methods of securing
- T-track
- T-nuts
- Blue Painters tape and Cyanoacrilate
- Cam clamps
- Using your fingers to hold down really small pieces.

### What Software can be used?
#### Fusion360
#### VCarve (Pro/Aspire)
#### Carbide Create
#### Blender
#### Inkscape
